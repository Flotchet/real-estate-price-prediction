It aims to predict prices for houses or appartment considering the current state of the market.

## Current state

* Finalized

## What it does (In order)

### Combine other dataset to the previous one and Cleaning the data

1. get new data from external sources xlsx and csv
2. Combine different data set to add features
3. clean the data by removing outliers and droping NaN and None
