## How to use it

You can launch the main.py to get a simple user interface to launch the project or part of it.

You can make the docker image from the deployment part everything is ready for it

You can also launch each part of the project independently or import part of the project as a library (part of the project are already capable of working on any kind of website or data)

## Prerequises (Global)

Python 3.11.1 64-bit

Firefox

*Tested on Fedora release 37 (Thirty Seven) x86_64 kernel 6.0.15-300.fc37.x86_64 but it should works on most linux distro
